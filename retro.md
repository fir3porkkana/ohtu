## Retrospective techniques

Glad, sad and mad is a certain way of performing a retrospective meeting, and works circa as follows.
Each team member writes down observations they've made during the sprint on seperate post it notes. Afterwards, the notes are gathered in one place and each one is presented and clarified to everyone.
The notes are then grouped into three categories: glad, sad and mad. The team votes on which category of notes is discussed more in dept, and notes are then voted on from the selected category. Finally, the selected observations are then discussed and folks voice their opinions on the matter.
Discussion ends whenever there are no more notes left or the timeframe of 60 minutes has passed.

Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of has the group draw on a flip chart blobs of correspong categories, and then placing things inside them. Then, the team is to comment on each category. Essentially, this is just a frame for discussion that ensures each of the said categories comes up in the context of the latest sprint.
